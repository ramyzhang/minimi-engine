### Minimi Engine for Minimi the Game!

I am working on creating a simple 2D game engine, assisted by SDL2, for an arcade-style desktop game. Runs on Mac with XCode, though I intend to learn how to compile this cross-platform with CMake later down the line ^_^
All game assets were created by me!

### Completed Systems

**Components:**
- CTransform
- CSprite
- CAnimator
- CBoxCollider

**Systems:**
- Basic ECS architecture completed!
- SMovement (basic player movement & follow-the-player enemy movement)
- SRenderer (wrapper for SDL_Renderer)
- SSpawner (spawns a player and enemies)
- SCollision (collision solver)
- SAudio (basic audio system)
- SObserver and SSubject for the observer/subject notifier system pattern

### To Do

**Systems:**
- Particles
- Animation state machine
- UI
- Scripts
- Camera
- Basic Scene Management (+ pausing)
- Game Logic (i.e. health, NPC states)
- Reading in game settings from a .txt file
- Better TileMap
